Description
Every Monday, the client XX1 sends me the P&P (policy & Procedures) files.
In the first week, these are the P&Ps produced up to that point. I then proceed to make comments and send them back to PLog. The following week, XX1 sends me all the P&Ps again, which may include: those that haven't been modified, those that have been changed according to my comments, and possibly new P&Ps. In the second week, I take all the P&Ps and compare them with those from the previous week to identify modified and new P&Ps. At this point, I pass the new and modified P&Ps to my team for their reviews and comments, after which I send them back to XX1 only those commented by us. In the next week (the third week), I will continue to receive from XX1 all the P&Ps, always containing those without changes, those modified, and those new. At this stage, I do not know how to compare these received in the third week with those from the second week.
If I compare the P&Ps received in the second week, which do not have my comments, with those of the third week, there will always be differences.
The major issue for me is that XX1 utilises an independent system, which we cannot access. Therefore, the files we send to them are physically different from the ones we receive. How can I a) Track the outcome of all the comments added by the TEAM in the various versions of the files b) Have in a single document the history of all versions and comments, considering that each time XX1 sends the PDFs, they are generated a new.
